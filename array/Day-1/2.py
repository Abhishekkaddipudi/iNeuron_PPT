ğŸ’¡ **Q2.** You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

**Example :**

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

Output: 5

Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Algorithm :
1. let max_profit =0
2. For each position , calculate the min_value till now 
            if min_value> price:
                min_value=price
            else:
                calculate: profit=price-min_value
3. max_profit = max(max_profit,profit)
